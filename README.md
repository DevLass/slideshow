#### *For this project i used flexbox and input radio*
#### *The display flex make the images stand next to each other*
#### *And the input radio makes that when a radio is marked, it changes its image with the margin left*
#### *The rest is just to beautify the site*
#### *In the future I would like to implement a timer to change images, like Instagram Stories*

###   *Thanks for reading, see you soon*

> *Never stop the griding.*
